# HASTI 

Home Assistant Store Themes & Integrations (HASTI for short) is a marketplace for developers to share their awesome smart home: Themes, Integrations, Scripts Automation etc..
The marketplace allows for users to easily find developers work through the powerful search bar, Tags or simply browsing.

## Why?
While trying to make a home smart & automate things like blinds, lights, security cameras etc I found it difficult to find what was out there and available. You either had to browse the [HA reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/)/[HA forums](https://community.home-assistant.io/) for threads which were often years old, depreciated or otherwise no-longer supported or be logged in and browse [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/). The current platforms / marketplaces doesnt allow developers full control over what and how their projects get shown off.

These methods are ok if you already have experience and know what youre doing. There was no way to simply browse as a beginner or easily see similarly related projects. 

So I created [HASTI.app](https://hasti.app/). Allowing developers full control over what and how their projects get displayed to users
