# TESTING WITH EUFY INTEGRATION READ ME AS ITS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF DIFFERENT MARKDOWN CONTENT

# Debugging Issues

First, check all issues (open or close) to find out if there was any similar question rather than duplicating it.
Focus on enabling push notification settings, lowering camera streaming/recording quality and removing any network level isoloation/restriction. Most of the issues could be eliminated via these.
Later on, if you find a similar issue, please just put +1 on it, sharing same logs over and over does not help at all.
Lastly, create your issue following the template. I will probably ask follow up questions later on.

I am more than happy to debug individual issues as long as you follow setup instructions. I need you to share your problematic cameras with me so that I can use my own machine to debug the issue. For each debugging request, please create a github issue so we can track from there. Do not forget to remove the sharing settings after we are done :)
